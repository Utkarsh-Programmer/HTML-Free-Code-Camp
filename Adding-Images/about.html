		<h1>Hi, I am Utkarsh Yadav</h1>
		<hr />

		<p>
			I sparked my interest in coding at 14, ignited by Iron Man's A.I.
			assistant, J.A.R.V.I.S. Its capabilities fascinated me, and I dreamt
			of creating my own A.I. assistant, following commands and delivering
			optimal results. However, creating an A.I. seemed daunting on my
			own. YouTube searches and Play Store explorations for "Jarvis-like
			apps" proved unfruitful.
		</p>

		<p>
			Then, a CodeWithHarry YouTube video titled "Build an A.I. Assistant
			like Jarvis using Python?" grabbed my attention. It dawned on me:
			programming was the key to building my own A.I. Assistant.
		</p>

		<p>
			My coding journey began with Python. Devouring CodeWithHarry's
			YouTube tutorials, I tackled his 129-video Python playlist. Armed
			with my phone and the Pydroid 3 app, I began coding. It was tricky;
			juggling tutorials and coding on the same small screen presented a
			challenge. As the tutorials advanced, running code on my phone grew
			increasingly difficult. Yet, these hurdles solidified my
			understanding of Python programming.
		</p>

		<p>
			Next, fortune unearthed a dusty 8-year-old laptop at home. Its weak
			specs and Windows 7 OS presented new hurdles. Installing Python took
			a month, with missing or corrupted .dll files adding to the
			struggle. The latest Python version was 3.10, but Windows 7 only
			supported 3.7.6, forcing a compromise. My code editor, Visual Studio
			Code, was far from optimal, running sluggishly and occasionally
			freezing, requiring a frustrating reboot. This rough-and-tumble
			experience proved to be my baptism by fire with Windows, offering an
			in-depth understanding of its intricacies. On this relic, I even
			took my first steps into web development, laying a basic foundation
			for the future.
		</p>

		<p>
			Finally, I received my first brand-new laptop. Exhilarated, I delved
			deeper into Python, mastering GUI creation, API integration, game
			development, and advanced logic building. The world of data science
			and automation also piqued my interest. Subsequently, web
			development truly captured my heart. Crafting websites became my new
			passion, eclipsing the dream of a Jarvis-like A.I. assistant.
